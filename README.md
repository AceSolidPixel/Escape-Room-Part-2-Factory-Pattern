# Escape-Room-Part-2-Factory-Pattern
The different
types of doors implementing the Door interface are the products. Create the DoorFactory
class that has a createDoor method and an openDoor method. In main, construct a
DoorFactory object, then loop 3 times to make a random number for one of your doors
and pass that value to openDoor of your DoorFactory object. The openDoor method
should use the type value to call createDoor, and then call the functions of Door to allow
the user to open the door. The output should be exactly the same as it was before.
